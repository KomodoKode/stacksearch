Hello! It seems that you want to use the wonderful tool of ``stacksearch``! Well, it's
quite a simple journey. But enough talk, let's get started!

Installation
----------------

This package can be easily installed via ``pip`` or ``python3 -m pip``.

**Warning: This package relies on python 3.8 and above. You won't be able to install this
package if you are using anything lower.**

To check your python version, run the following command:
``python3 -V``

it should say something like this:

``Python 3.8.2``

if it doesn't, try running ``python3.8 -V`` explicitly.

After you ran `pip install stacksearch` (or `python3.8 -m pip install stacksearch`), you
should be able to run the following command without any hassle:

``stacksearch``

it would only show an error if the place your installation command isn't in your ``$PATH`` variable. If so, just run ``python3.8 -m stacksearch`` for the rest of the tutorial.
