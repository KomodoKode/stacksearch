.SH QUICKSTART GUIDE
.sp
So, you’ve seen it on PyPi, you’ve noticed it on GitHub, and now want to know how to use \fBstacksearch\fP? This quickstart guide will help you understand most of the features of stacksearch. It’ll cover basic usage, options, and some of the API features. So, without further ado, let’s dive in!
.SS Installation
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
To install stacksearch, \fByou must have python version 3.8 or higher\fP\&.
The reason for this is because \fBstacksearch\fP requires this feature of \fBargparse\fP that \fBno other python version supports.\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can easily install \fBstacksearch\fP via \fBpip\fP:
.sp
\fBpip install stacksearch\fP
.sp
or
.sp
\fBpython3.8 \-m install stacksearch\fP
.sp
or you can install it manually via \fBgit clone\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mkdir stacksearch
git clone https://github.com/ThatXliner/stacksearch.git
.ft P

.SS Basic Tasks
.sp
\fBstacksearch\fP is designed so that \fIanyone can use it, with ease.\fP
.sp
To refer to the commands \fBstacksearch\fP provides (or the help menu), you can type \fBstacksearch \-\-help\fP or \fBstacksearch \-h\fP\&.
.sp
To search StackOverflow directly from the command\-line, do \fBstacksearch this is your query\fP or \fBpython3.8 \-m stacksearch this is your query\fP and replace ‘this is your query’ with the query string you want to search for.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

.INDENT 3.5
For the rest of this tutorial, we’ll refer your preferred stacksearch command as stacksearch for simplicity
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Options
.sp
You can also provide \fIadditional\fP options to \fBstacksearch\fP\&.
.sp
For example, say you want to search \fIall\fP of the StackExchange you know, then you would run \fBstacksearch this is your query \-\-sites ...\fP (replace ‘…’ with the sites you want to search)
.sp
Or maybe you just don’t want so much debug information filling up your terminal, then you can pass the \fI–silent\fP option. Which could also be shortened to \fI\-s\fP\&.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
DO NOT CONFUSE THE \fB\-s\fP OPTION WITH THE \fB\-\-sites\fP OPTION! THEY ARE NOT THE SAME!!
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or \fImaybe\fP you want JSON output that \fIyou\fP can use. Then you can pass the \fB\-\-json\fP option, the \fB\-j\fP option, the \fB\-\-raw\-data\fP option, the \fB\-\-raw\fP option, or the \fB\-r\fP option. It’ll output raw JSON data instead of beautifully formatted (and elegantly colorized) question\-and\-answers.

An example of how simple stacksearch’s API is:
.sp
To prove how simple, yet powerful, stacksearch is
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from stacksearch.Searcher import Search
print(Search("How do i code python"))
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And then, from just 2 lines of code, you can effectively search for answers on StackOverflow using the simple stacksearch API.
.sp
But, if you want to search for multiple questions \fIasynchronously\fP, you can use the asynchronous stacksearch API instead:
.sp
This is the asynchronous stacksearch API
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from stacksearch.Searcher import fSearch
import asyncio
async def main():
    stuff = []
    stuff.append(await fSearch(\(aqHow do i code python\(aq))
    stuff.append(await fSearch(\(aqHow do make my own object\(aq))
    stuff.append(await fSearch(\(aqWhat are objects\(aq))
    stuff.append(await fSearch(\(aq[python] lists\(aq))
    return stuff
print(asyncio.run(main))
.ft P
.fi

If you want to.

The asynchronous API is only decently stable. The StackExchange server may stop requests from too much asynchronous operations.

.TP
.B Search(Query[, print_prog = True, search_on_site = "stackoverflow", *args, **kwargs])
This function is the main “meat” of stacksearch. It will search stackoverflow (or any other StackExchange site specified) for your search query.
.sp
If you want to print the progress (which by default is true), then you can set the argument “print_prog” to “true”.
.sp
If you want to search on other StackExchange sites, you can set the argument “search_on” to the URL of the StackExchange site to search (including or excluding the \fB\&.com\fP suffix).

.TP
.B fSearch(Query[, print_prog = True, search_on_site = "stackoverflow", *args, **kwargs])
This function is almost identical to the \fBSearch\fP function defined above except that it is \fIasynchronous\fP\&.
